This project combines HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive web application. It features a container with a distinctive black border and a soothing gray background. Inside this container, colorful balls come to life, each with a unique color, and initial velocity. These balls move about freely within the container, creating a visually captivating animation.
The magic behind this animation is made possible by JavaScript's setInterval function. It continuously updates the position of each ball at regular intervals. As these balls traverse the container, they interact dynamically with the container's walls, bouncing off them and producing an engaging and lively visual display.
